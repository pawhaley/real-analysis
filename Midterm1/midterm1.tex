\begin{document}
Note that I am operating under the convention that $N,n,m,i,j$ are natural numbers unless otherwise specified.  Also note that I am operating under a convention that $\sum=\sum_{n=1}^\infty$ and the convention that $\sum_i^j=\sum_{n=i}^j$.
\begin{exercise}

Let $A$ and $B$ be nonempty sets that are bounded above. Suppose $\sup A < \sup B$. Prove that there is an element of $B$ that is an upper bound for $A$.
\end{exercise}
Suppose $A$ and $B$ are nonempty sets that are bounded above. Furthur suppose $\sup A < \sup B$. Define $a=\sup A$ and $b=\sup B$.  Note that $a$ is less than the suppremum of $B$ thus $a$ is not a upper bound on $B$.  Since $a$ is not a upper bound on $B$ there must exist at least one element of $B$ grater than $a$, take one of these elements lets call it $k$, $k\in B$, $a<k$.

\begin{document}
Note that I am operating under the convention that $N,n,m,i,j$ are natural numbers unless otherwise specified.  I am also operating under the convention $v_a(b)=\{x\in\mathbb{R}:|x-b|<a\}$
\begin{exercise}
1
Suppose $f : A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $c$ is a limit point of $A$. Suppose $f (x) \geq 0$ for all $x \in A$ and that
$lim_{x \rightarrow c}f (x)$ exists. Show that the limit is non-negative. Provide two proofs, one $\epsilon$ - $\delta$
style, and the other using the sequential characterization of limits.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $f : A \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ and $c$ is a limit point of $A$. Suppose $f (x) \geq 0$ for all $x \in A$ and that
$lim_{x \rightarrow c}f (x)=L$ exists.\\
Suppose $L<0$.  Define $\epsilon=-L/2>0$.  There must exist a $\delta>0$ such that for all $x\in A$ where $0<|x-c|<\delta$, $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$.  Note that $c$ is a limit point of $A$, thus $V_\delta(c)\cap A-\{c\}\neq \emptyset$.  Take one of the elements of this set $a\in V_\delta(c)\cap A-\{c\}$.  Note that $a\neq c$.  Note that $a\in A$.  Note $|a-c|<\delta$.  Thus $|f(a)-L|<\epsilon$ and so $L-\epsilon<f(a)<L+\epsilon=L/2<0$.  A contradiction, we know that $f(a)\geq 0$ and now we have $f(a)<0$.
\end{proof}

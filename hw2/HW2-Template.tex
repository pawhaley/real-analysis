\begin{exercise}{1.4.1}
Recall that $\mathbb{I}$ stands for the set of irrational numbers.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item Show that if $a,b\in\Rats$ then $ab$ and $a+b\in\Rats$ as well.
\item Show that if $a\in\Rats$ and $t\in\mathbb{I}$ then $a+t\in\mathbb{I}$ and if $a\neq 0$ then $at\in\mathbb{I}$ as well.
\item Part (a) says that the rational numbers are closed under multiplication
and addition.  What can be said about $st$ and $s+t$ when $s,t\in\mathbb{I}$?
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
\item \begin{proof}
Select two arbitrary elements from the rational numbers, since they are rational we can represent them as $i/j$ and $m/n$ where $i,j,m,n\in \mathbb{Z}$ and $j\neq 0$ and $n\neq 0$.\\\\
Note that $i/j*m/n=\frac{im}{jn}$, from the definition of multiplication of rational numbers.  Since the multiple of any two non-zero numbers is non-zero and since the multiple of any two integers is a integer so $jn\in \mathbb{Z}-\{0\}$ and $im\in \mathbb{Z}$ therfore $\frac{im}{jn}\in \mathbb{Q}$.\\\\
Note that $i/j+m/n=\frac{in+mj}{jn}$, from the definition of addition of rational numbers.  Since the multiple of any two non-zero numbers is non-zero and since the multiple of any two integers is a integer so $jn\in \mathbb{Z}-\{0\}$ and $in,mj\in \mathbb{Z}$ and so also $in+mj \in \mathbb{Z}$ therfore $\frac{in+mj}{jn}\in \mathbb{Q}$.
\end{proof}

\item \begin{proof}
Proof by contradiction.\\
Suppose that there exists $a\in\Rats$ and $t\in\mathbb{I}$ where $a+t=b\notin\mathbb{I}$.  Since the reals are closed under addition we can say $b\in\mathbb{R}$.  Note that $b\in\mathbb{R} -\mathbb{I}=\mathbb{Q}$.  We can do a little math and see $a+t=b$ means $t=b+(-a)$.  Since the addative inverse of a rational is a rational and since the sum of two rationals is rational we conclude $t\in \mathbb{Q}$.  A contradiction has been reached, the rationals and irrationals are, by deffinition, mutualy exclusive and so $t$ cannot be a element of both.\\\\
Proof by contradiction.\\
Suppose that there exists $a\in\Rats-\{0\}$ and $t\in\mathbb{I}$ where $at=b\notin\mathbb{I}$.  Since the reals are closed under multiplication, and since the multiple of any two non zero numbers is itself non zero, we can say $b\in\mathbb{R}-\{0\}$.  Note that $b\in\mathbb{R}-\{0\} -\mathbb{I}=\mathbb{Q}-\{0\}$.  We can do a little math and see $at=b$ means $t=b(a^{-1})$.  Since the multiplicative inverse of a non zero rational is a rational (informaly $(\frac{i}{m})(\frac{m}{i})=1$) and since the multiple of two rationals is rational we conclude $t\in \mathbb{Q}$.  A contradiction has been reached, the rationals and irrationals are, by deffinition, mutualy exclusive and so $t$ cannot be a element of both.
\end{proof}

\item 
All we can conclude is that $st\in \mathbb{R}-\{0\}$ and that $s+t\in \mathbb{R}$.  As a example that the irrationals are not closed with respect to multiplication or addition note that $\sqrt{2}\sqrt{2}=2$ and that $\pi+(-\pi)=0$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}{1.4.2}
Let $A\subseteq \Reals$ be nonempty and bounded above. Let $s\in\Reals$ have
the property that for all $n\in\Nats$, $s+(1/n)$ is an upper bound for $A$
but $s-(1/n)$ is not an upper bound for $A$.  Show that $s=\sup A$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{1.4.3} Show that $\cap_{n=1}^\infty (0,1/n)=\emptyset$.

\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{1.4.4} \W 

Let $a<b$ be real numbers and let $T=[a,b]\cap\Rats$.
Show that $\sup T=a$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{exercise}{1.4.5} Use Exercise 1.4.1 to provide a proof of Corollary 1.4.4 by considering real numbers $a-\sqrt{2}$ and $b-\sqrt{2}$.

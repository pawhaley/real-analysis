\begin{document}
Note that I am operating under the convention that $N,n,m,i,j$ are natural numbers unless otherwise specified.  I am also operating under the convention $v_a(b)=\{x\in\mathbb{R}:b-a<x<b+a\}$
\begin{exercise}

IVT\\
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
Suppose $f:[a,b]\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function with $f(a)<f(b)$.  Choose $v\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(a)<v<f(b)$.  Define for $Y\subseteq\mathbb{R}$, $f^{-1}(Y)=\{a\in A:f(a)\in Y\}$.  Define $A_v=f^{-1}((-\infty,v))$.  Note that $f(a)<v$ and so $a\in A_v$.  Note that for all $x\in A_v$, $x\in A$ and thus $x<=b$ and so $b$ is a upper bound on $A_v$.  Since $A_v$ is bounded and non-empty it has a suppremum.  Define $x=\sup(A_v)$.  We have previously proven there is a sequence $A_v$ that converges to $x$, This can be easily proven since $[\sup(S)-1/n,\sup(S)]\cap S\neq \emptyset$ for all $n\in\mathbb{N}$, call this sequence $\{a_n\}$.  Note that $f(a_n)\in (-\infty,v)$ since $a_n\in A_v$, thus $f(a_n)<v$.
